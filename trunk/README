OpenSeqSLAM is an open source Matlab implementation of the original SeqSLAM
algorithm published by Milford and Wyeth at ICRA12 [1]. SeqSLAM performs place
recognition by matching sequences of images. 

Quick start guide: 
 - Download the Nordland dataset:
     cd datasets/norland; ./getDataset.bash; 
 - start Matlab and run demo.m from within the matlab directory
